  <p>ScrapeOpen is a collaborative project. It curates the publication of code to scrape websites serving <b>public data sets</b> and presents them in a <b>format accessible to humans and machines</b>.</p>
  <h2>What's public data set</h2>
  <p>A public data set is a collection of observations collected by a public agency (not-for-profit) and having a public value. In order to be published, the data set must not be proprietary.</p>
  <h2>What is an accessible format</h2>
  <p>Data sets published by ScrapeOpen project have at least 3 stars in Tim Berners-Lee’s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171215123649/http://5stardata.info/en/" target="_blank">5-star Open Data plan</a></p>
  <blockquote>
<table>
  <tr><td>★</td><td>make your stuff available on the Web (whatever format) under an open license</td></tr>
  <tr><td>★★</td><td>make it available as structured data (e.g., Excel instead of image scan of a table)</td></tr>
  <tr><td>★★★</td><td>make it available in a non-proprietary open format (e.g., CSV instead of Excel)</td></tr>
  <tr><td>★★★★</td><td>use URIs to denote things, so that people can point at your stuff</td></tr>
  <tr><td>★★★★★</td><td>link your data to other data to provide context</td></tr>
