  <p>ScrapeOpen is a collaborative project. It curates the publication of code to scrape websites serving <i>public data sets</i> and presents them in a <i>format accessible to humans and machines</i>.</p>
  <h2>What's a public data set</h2>
  <p>A public data set is a collection of observations published by a public agency (not-for-profit) and having public value. In order to be published, the data set must not be proprietary.</p>
  <h2>What's an accessible format</h2>
  <p>Data sets published by ScrapeOpen project have 3 stars in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171215123649/http://5stardata.info/en/#by-example" target="_blank">5-star Open Data plan:</a></p>
  <blockquote cite="Tim Berners-Lee">
<table>
  <tr><td>★</td><td>make your stuff available on the Web (whatever format) under an open license</td></tr>
  <tr><td>★★</td><td>make it available as structured data (e.g., Excel instead of image scan of a table)</td></tr>
  <tr><td>★★★</td><td>make it available in a non-proprietary open format (e.g., CSV instead of Excel)</td></tr>
  <tr><td>★★★★</td><td>use URIs to denote things, so that people can point at your stuff</td></tr>
  <tr><td>★★★★★</td><td>link your data to other data to provide context</td></tr>
</table>
</blockquote>
<p>That is, every data set is</p>
<ul>
  <li><i>structured</i>, with metadata defining every attribute of each observations,</li>
  <li>and published in a <i>non proprietary format</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Possibly, entities described in the data sets (e.g. people, places) are also <i>linked to other data</i>.</p>
  <h2>How you can help</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Indicate interesting websites</li>
    <li>Write or maintain the code to scrape a resource</li>
    <li>Control or improve the quality of the data sets</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If you want to contribute, please have a look at the <a href="">project documentation</a>.</p>
